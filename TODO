Add vote index by user-and-snippet, and by user-and-refactor

Maybe move "Ruby/Written in Ruby" into floated-right div under other div

Make vote buttons actual links, so we'll get the cursor changes on mouseover

Disable show buttons on refactors

Disable edit/destroy buttons for refactors depending on current user

Disable edit/destroy buttons for snippets depending on current user
